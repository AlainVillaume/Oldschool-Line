# Oldschool-Line

It's a very old piece of assembly code, that used to work on a 80x86 processor (Intel/Dos/PC)
When launched, the code wait for two points (mouse click), and generate a serie of pixels from the first to the other.
It's given as a code sample only, as it's certainly useless today.. but it may be interresting for study.
